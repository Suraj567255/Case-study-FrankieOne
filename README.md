## Case Study on FrankieOne - Australian RegTech Company

## Overview and Origin

*   FrankieOne is a global regulatory technology (regtech) company, headquartered in Melbourne, founded in 2017 by Simon 
Costello and Aaron Chipper with the goal of revolutionising the world of banking.
Initially, they were looking to build the next great neobank. It was during this process that they discovered first-hand how clunky and disjointed customer onboarding processes were within banks and other fintechs. The threat of severe penalties for getting this wrong meant that the primary focus when designing customer onboarding had been on compliance, which often came at the detriment of customer experience. What Simon and Aaron learned is that it didn’t need to be one or the other. It was with that realisation that FrankieOne was born.
This Melbourne company that originally set out to be a neobank has found its sweet spot in anti-fraud technology, attracting $20 million in Series A funding with investors including Robinhood founder Vlad Tenev drawn to its 20-fold annual recurring revenue growth and onboarding compliance proposition. FrankieOne has developed a unified solution for customer onboarding and fraud prevention. The company’s easy-to-use, online service draws data from over 320 sources around the world. It enables finance companies to manage KYC and AML checks swiftly and securely.

## Business Activities:

* FrankieOne helps banks, fintechs and other regulated entities manage their regulatory compliance with  single API and dashboard, which connects to hundreds of global identity and fraud-monitoring providers across the world. They also make it easier for their clients to scale and onboard customers by providing a better and more cost-effective user experience, whilst also potentially saving them millions of dollars in regulatory fines and protecting their customers from fraud.

* It's customers are digitally focused financial institutions and fintech companies including major global banks, neobanks platform banks and rapidly scaling fintech companies. As the fintech industry is growing and growing including online bankings and transactions, the market size for this set of customers is endless and ever growing.
* The growth in financial crime has alarmed worldwide regulatory watchdogs, giving rise to RegTech. Businesses in the digital age are utilizing innovative technologies to comply with the shifting regulatory landscape effectively. Regtech not only reduces the cost of compliance processes but also improves their quality, making procedures more resilient and decreasing friction and the danger of compliance failures. 
FrankieOne helps banks and fintechs make better decisions using a single API and dashboard to manage KYC/AML and fraud. Frankie is a cloud-native, end-to-end platform that automates data capture and decisioning for customer acquisition and ongoing monitoring. It handles the orchestration of all 3rd party tools from biometrics, KYC, KYB, AML through to fraud tools. It's a SaaS offering, no expensive infrastructure, fully hosted and managed always up to date. With access to 160+ data sources, Frankie enables companies to make better decisions with more information. Frankie makes it easy for companies to quickly and safely onboard more customers, mitigating fraud and high-cost financial risk. Frankie connects compliance and risk data sources to a single API that unifies how its customer base onboard and monitor their customers, meeting global regulatory requirements.
Frankie went to market with a SaaS consumption model — customers are charged a SaaS fee that gives them access to Frankie's software in addition to a transaction fee charged for each API call (which equates to product usage, across any of: KYC, AML, KYB, IDV and new products to come). The transaction fee (or consumption-based component) cost per unit varies by product and the volume of usage. Frankie released a Stripe-like widget enabling customers to create their own customized onboarding flows with only a couple lines of code, auto-populating personalized screens that would otherwise have taken weeks to build.
Frankie also focused on shortening the TTV ("time-to-value") for its customers by rolling out Smart UI onboarding screens for its end customers, which improved usability and resulted in a much timelier increase in the pass-through rate for Frankie's customer

## Landscape:

Frankieone is in the domain of RegTech also known as regulation technology. In simple terms RegTech refers to any technology that ensures companies comply with their regulatory requirements.
* With expanding demand for digital financial services and an increase in criminal activity, various possibilities for the RegTech business are arising. Big data, cloud computing, and machine learning algorithms, in particular, can be used by the industry to assist heavily regulated businesses as well as regulatory bodies through a set of computerized risk management procedures, regulatory reporting solutions, and the process of internal compliance policies.
Data protection is one of the main concerns for the RegTech business. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the use of personally identifiable information. This regulates the use of consumer data and establishes online data protection rights. As a result, RegTech solution providers and their clients must adhere to data protection requirements. In addition, some data analytics software uses client data for improved analysis. As a result, it is the industry's obligation to guarantee that data does not fall into the hands of the wrong people.
RegTech has emerged as an appropriate alternative for enhancing financial services by increasing the transparency of transactions between counterparties. RegTech has become a critical instrument in most firms for carrying out Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedures.RegTech firms use advanced technological algorithms to support decision-making.
The major companies in this domain are as : - 
1. Chainalysis
2. ComplyAdvantage
3. Ascent Regtech

5. Hummingbird
6. Continuity
7. Trunomi

## Recommendations

* we are digitally evolving everyday. Technologies are getting advanced and so are the problems. After the fintech revolution we all can see, the next big thing is the cryptocurrency and blockchain which have grown to become a massive subject. A lot of digital coins and NFTs have been making some big noises globally. This is increasing and a lot of people are getting involved which will directly mean more online transactions. Security can be an issue for their digital asset and information. Therefore, my advise to FrankieOne is to be one of the pioneer in the crypto world and expand their services in this area of fintech.

Soon, the way we bank, the way we do business is directly or indirectly gooing to be impacted by crypto or digital coins and assets. To become the first to detect problems and provide solutions in this means the company will have a strong base in the future and they have a good chance of more scalability than their competitors.
As most of the digital coins and NFTs are based on blockchain, frankieOne should hire good blockchain Ddvelopers and use this technology to provide effeciemt and effective services to company and individual. The way a RegTech company operates is going to evolve, so the company should start adapting new technology and brace themselves for stepping into the future.
